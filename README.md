# Document Summary Assistant  

## Overview  
The **Document Summary Assistant** is an application designed to extract and summarize text from various document formats, including PDFs and images. This tool automates the summarization process, making it easier to access and process key information from lengthy documents. The solution is ideal for education, research, business, and any domain dealing with large volumes of unstructured text.

## Key Features  

### 1. Document Upload  
- **File Upload Options**: Drag-and-drop or file picker interface for ease of use.  
- **Supported Formats**: PDFs and image files (e.g., scanned documents).  

### 2. Text Extraction  
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from PDFs while preserving basic formatting.  
- **OCR for Images**: Uses **Tesseract OCR** to extract text from scanned image files.  

### 3. Summary Generation  
- Automatically generates **smart summaries** to highlight main ideas and key points.  
- **Phase 2 Enhancements (Planned)**:  
  - Provide options for summary length (short, medium, long).  
  - Beautify and improve the interface for better usability.

## Approach  

The development of this application was a combination of learning and implementing. I initially started with **plain Python** for the backend due to its simplicity and vast library support. However, as the project evolved, I transitioned to **Flask** to better handle requests and create a well-structured backend.  

### Core Methodology  
- **Text Extraction**:  
  - Leveraged Python libraries for PDFs.  
  - Integrated **Tesseract OCR** for image-based text extraction.  
- **Summary Generation**:  
  - Built on pre-trained NLP models to produce concise, relevant summaries.  

The transition to Flask streamlined development, helping me complete the application efficiently within the limited timeline.

## Current Status  

- **Version 1.0**:  
  - Functional features include file uploads, text extraction, and basic summaries.  
  - Hosted online for accessibility.  

- **Final Finishing ()**:  
  - Introduce summary length options (short, medium, long).  
  - UI/UX improvements, including loading states and polished design.

## Deliverables

- **Hosted Application**: Access the application online using Render.  
- **Source Code**: Available on GitHub with a detailed README.  
- **Adding features**: focusing on enhancements and produced summary size.
